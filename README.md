@dependency: Zebra Scanner SDK for Android v2.1.4.0

The app demonstrates a simple inventory control.
1) There are two items: Milk and Sugar where they are predefined with an initial stock value. 
2) The values get decreased one by one whenever the user scans the relevant barcodes.
3) Scanner makes Long beep for the stock values which can be divided by number 5.   (x%5==0)
4) Whenever the user click's "Info menu button" it will display Scanner info. (demonstrates RSM)
